### Pre-rendering & data fetching

Static vs Server-side Page generation
how to fetch data with next.


##### Static Generation
Pre-generate a page (with data prepared on the server-side) during build time.
Pages are prepared ahead to time and can be cached by the server / CDN serving the app.

```
export async function getStaticProps(context){ ... }
```

###### Incremental static Generation
Pre-generate Page -> Re-generate it on every request, at most every X seconds.

Either : Serve 'old' page if re-generation is not needed yet !
OR: Generate, store and serve 'new' page otherwise.

#### Pre-generated Paths

```
export async function getStaticPaths() {...}

```


#### Fallbacks
